### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mat, QA Manager at Linius Technologies. I've been in the industry for over 20 years, the vast majority of which has 
been spent in QA/software testing roles across industry sectors including defence and oil & gas. I've worked at companies 
ranging from start-ups to multi-nationals and much prefer the former. I've been hands-on my entire career and plan to stay
that way as I am passionate about software quality. A few years ago, having spent much of my career in manual testing roles
or working with outdated technology, I began an extensive program of reskilling and self-development around automated testing using resources such
as LinkedIn Learning and Test Automation University that continues to this day.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a portfolio of automated testing example projects in a variety of programming languages and using a range of tools and technologies.

I hope these projects can be used to kickstart future projects - whether that's my own personal projects or new work 
projects - and also for others to learn from and maybe use as a starting point for their own projects since these example 
repos are all public. I am taking the various skills and tools I have learned, both on the job and from training courses, 
and am developing projects that capture what I have learned. That way I have a record of what I have learned and having 
put it in practice I am less likely to forget it. It also means I have something to refer back to even after I have left 
a particular role and no longer have access to the code I wrote for that organisation. 

I am using publicly available resources (e.g. websites, APIs etc) in my projects so am not reliant on proprietary materials.
For example, if I learn something in Cypress at work, I will try to incorporate that same trick into a personal project 
that uses a publicly available website intended for training purposes. 

While my repos are largely examples of automated testing projects, most of them are more than bare bones templates as I
enjoy writing automated tests and find that I learn more from each project I develop.

:seedling: Iâ€™m currently learning:
- how to automate accessibility testing
- how to write better Python
- HTML/CSS development (FreeCodeCamp)
- codeless automated testing tools

:books: I plan to learn more about:
- visual testing
- TypeScript
- TestNG
- JUnit 5
- Playwright
- TestCafe
- Puppeteer
- C#
- SpecFlow
- Behave (Python)
- React
